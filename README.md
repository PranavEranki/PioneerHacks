# ProtectTheCommunes

Pioneer Hacks project - march 2017.
My second hackathon, so the app is not fully functional. Built in IOS.
This is an app that allows you to communicate with others in your area concerning food, hotels, attractions, and 
more as if you were a tourist. There are different 'classes' for users, 'Novice' and 'Expert', pertaining to their 
level of experience and comfort in their current area. 
This project utilized the Google Maps API for iOS.
